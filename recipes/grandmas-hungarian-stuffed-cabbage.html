    <h2>A Slow-Cooker version of Stuffed Cabbage</h2>
    <p class="orange">This is a recipe passed down from my great-grandmother, with a few shortcuts she approved of. Although the total time to make this dish is almost 8 hours, most of it it hands off. You do the work early, then sit back and let it cook. While the smell of this delicious meal fills your home, you get ready to eat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 head cabbage</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup uncooked white rice, rinsed</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) can tomato juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook cabbage in boiling water until outer leaves pull away easily from the head, 3 to 5 minutes. Separate leaves and let cool. Reserve 1 1/2 cup cooking water.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in wet rice; cook and stir until moisture evaporates, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Mix beef, sausage, and egg together in a large bowl. Stir in cooled rice mixture.</li>
      <li>Place a golfball-sized amount of the beef mixture on the ribbed end of a cabbage leaf; roll up, tucking in the sides. Repeat with remaining beef mixture and cabbage leaves.</li>
      <li>Place rolls seam-side down in a slow cooker. Cover with tomato juice. Pour reserved cooking water on top.</li>
      <li>Cook on High for 30 minutes. Switch to Low and cook for 6 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
